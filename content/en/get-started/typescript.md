# Get Started with TypeScript

TypeScript is [JavaScript](./javascript.md) with types, improved syntax, and better tooling.

## Possible Setups:

- [**Basic setup:** using te default tool](#basic-setup)
- [**Better setup (recommended):** using the modern tool that is better and more efficient](#better-setup)

## Basic Setup

TypeScript can be installed from: https://www.typescriptlang.org/download/

Once installed, you can check the version:

```sh
tsc --version
```

## Better Setup

Instead of using the default TypeScript `tsc`, you can use [tsx](https://tsx.is/)

`tsx` can be installed from: https://tsx.is/getting-started

Once installed, you can check the version:

```sh
tsx --version
```
